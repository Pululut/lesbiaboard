# Lesbiaboard

A PHP-based board software developed by quirky transbians for quirky transbians (and maybe some others too, 
depends on whether you want to use this software).

## Warning!!

Please note that you are using a version of Lesbiaboard obtained from the Git
repository. It is recommended that you use a stable version from the Releases tab of the repository,
rather than an interim version (unless you are testing for us, which we are more than happy to see).

```"If any of you, in any way, hate homosexuals, people of a different color or women, please do this one favor for us â€” leave us the fuck alone."```

## Requirements and Recommendations

* PHP 7.3 or newer.
* MariaDB 10.1 or newer. Oracle MySQL >5.7 is not supported.
* HTTP web server
* PHP extensions: mysqli, gd, xml, curl (for Discord Integration)
 
## Installation

[Download Lesbiaboard](https://github.com/transbian-alliance/lesbiaboard/archive/master.zip),
upload it to the web root of your server (usually /www/ or /public_html/), and visit the location of Lesbiaboard
in your server. The interactive installer should take care of everything.

For more information, check the documentation [here](https://github.com/transbian-alliance/lesbiaboard/wiki/Installing).

## Feedback

Create an issue [here on this repository](https://github.com/transbian-alliance/lesbiaboard/issues) for any bug reports.
General support is available on [the Lesbiaboard forum](https://forums.transbian.love), too.

## Contributions

Fork the repository and send a pull request. This project uses tab-based
indentation and opening braces on separate lines, so keep that in mind while
contributing patches.

You can also contribute in other ways too, such as documentation, translations, being an active member of the forums or spreading the word if you like our software, creating themes, ranksets and/or plugins, or hell, if you feel really nice, making a toasted sandwich breakfast for us while we're snuggled up in bed one morning... <3
